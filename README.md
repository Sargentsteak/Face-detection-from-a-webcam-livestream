Detection of multiple faces from a live stream or a video

1. This is a very basic program that detects multiple faces from a livestream using haarcascade algorithm.
2. You just need to install opencv first using the command
  pip install opencv-python
3. You can also download the .xml file mentioned in the code from the haarcascade github page. Go to raw and download the code from there.
